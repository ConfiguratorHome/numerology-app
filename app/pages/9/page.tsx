          In your life, the number 1 holds significance in various aspects such
          as career, success, job, business, communication, and personality.
          Represented by the element of water, it influences organs like the
          kidneys and ears, along with colors like black and deep blue, and is
          associated with the Sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number 1 signifies how a person interacts and communicates with
          others, showcasing optimism and representing the north direction. It
          controls the kidneys and ears in the body and represents the middle
          son in the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the number 1 is missing in someone&apos;s life, they may struggle
          with progressing without guidance or support from others. In this
          century, we will find people without the number 1 in their charts
          again, which was nearly impossible for the past thousand years. Those
          without the number 1 may find it challenging to express their
          personalities and may rely more on others for help and nurture. They
          might lack a sense of creativity and struggle to express their
          emotions effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remedies include worshipping the Sun, offering water to the Sun,
          wearing a Sun yantra, and wearing pearls.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those missing the number 1, remedies and suggestions include
          fulfilling the lack of wealth to complete the missing aspect of their
          life represented by the number 1. Place water-filled vessels in the
          northeast or east. Offer water to the Sun in a copper vessel in the
          morning. Keep an aquarium. Place a fountain or swimming pool in the
          north direction. Offer water to thirsty individuals. Associate with
          people born on the 1st, 10th, and 28th dates, and build relationships
          with them.
